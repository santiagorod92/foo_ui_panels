// Vendored copy of foo_navidrome's NavidromeLibraryService.h (interface + GUID only, no

// service_enum_t<navidrome_library_api> — zero instances when foo_navidrome isn't installed.
//
// Publishes the Navidrome server's music library (every album, plus cover art and a "play this
// album" action) to other foobar2000 components, so e.g. a custom skin's album browser can show
// what the server has even though none of it is in the local Media Library (navidrome:// tracks
// only become metadb entries once they're played or queued).
//
// Query via service_enum_t<navidrome_library_api>; zero enumerated instances when foo_navidrome
// isn't installed (or on a platform that doesn't implement it), so callers must check first.
//
// ABI: the two components are separate DLLs with their own CRTs, so nothing owned by std::/pfc
// containers crosses the boundary — albums stream through a caller-implemented sink as plain
// const char*/int, and cover bytes come back as an album_art_data service object.
